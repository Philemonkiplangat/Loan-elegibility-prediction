# Loan-elegibility-prediction
In this project, I analyzed data from a financial institution provided from Kaggle and trained the four machine learning algorithms, namely random forest,support vector machine,logistic regression and decision tree and the random forest became the best with a  training score of 96% and test score of 89%. The problem was to predict the bank customers who would be eligible to the loan.
