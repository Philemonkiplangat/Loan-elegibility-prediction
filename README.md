# Loan-elegibility-prediction
In this project, I analyzed data from a financial institution provided by Kaggle and trained the four machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBOOST and the xgboost became the best with a  training score of 99% and a test score of 90%. The problem was to predict the bank customers who would be eligible for the loan.
